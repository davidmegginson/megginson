    <h1>David Megginson, consultant</h1>

    <p>
      I am an independent consultant with 14 years' experience in the
      aid sector (11 with the UN), specialising in aid data and aid
      standards. Before that, I had decades of experience with
      standards, open data, open source, and technology architecture.
